# How to use

Both client and Server Jar files will be found in `out/artifacts`  

In order to run the whole scenario, you must first run the Server Jar File by entering `java -cp Server.jar Server` and then set up the port number you want the server to listen. 

Finally to run the client application, enter  `java -cp Client.jar Client` in a separate terminal.

Please note the clients port numbers should be same for Server application. 

By default, all port number and host for client and server are set to `9090` and `localhost`.
